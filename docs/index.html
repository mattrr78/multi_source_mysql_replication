<h1>Multi-Source MySQL Replication Demo</h1>
<p style="font-style: italic">Written by Matt Rosenberger.  Originally published on August 1st, 2022.</p>
<p>
    The purpose of this documentation is to demonstrate how easy Multi-Source Replication in MySQL is to setup.  This is
    using Source -> Replica (aka dated Master -> Slave).  Master-Master or MultiMaster Replication is not covered here.
    Please see <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/group-replication.html">Group Replication</a> for more
    information.
</p>
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>
    Nightly backups are a minimum requirement to running a business, but it may not be enough.  If a server goes down
    towards the end of the day, restoring from yesterday's backup means a customer's entire day's work is gone.
</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>
    Setting up a server dedicated to MySQL Replication is too simple of a procedure to not implement in production to avoid losing customer
    data. If production database ever goes down, all that is necessary is to stop replication, bringing a new server up,
    taking a backup from the replica server, and restoring that backup on the new server.
</p>
<h2>Additional Benefits</h2>
<p>
    Hosting MySQL database changes isn't the only thing the replication server can do.  You can also move expensive
    monitoring SQL queries or monitoring off of the production server and onto the replication server.
</p>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>
    Replica server starts out with exact copy of Source databases. Replica connects to Source database servers.
    Replica server is responsible for maintaining connection and will automatically reconnect.
    User created on each Source database only needs to be granted <span class="mono">REPLICATION SLAVE</span> permission.
    Changes made on the Source database server (UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE, etc.) are sent to Replica as events.
</p>
<h2>GTID-based Replication</h2>
<p>
    GTID: Global transaction identifiers used to assign a timestamped id to every transaction.
    MySQL documentation recommends using GTID-based replication to synchronize events.
    Once GTID is enabled, backups created from a database that wasn't using GTID will not be able to restored.
</p>
<h2>Multi-Source</h2>
<p>
    All multi-source replication means is one replication server hosting replications from multiple production servers.
    You do not have to do one production host to one replication server.  Since all we have to do is
    add a couple of new configuration options (changing logging from <span class="mono">FILE</span> to <span class="mono">TABLE</span>) and add
    <span class="mono">FOR CHANNEL 'channel_name'</span> to the end of all MySQL statements, why not start off with
    a multi-source replication approach.
</p>
<h2>Demo</h2>
<p>
    I used VirtualBox for this demo.  I use 2 databases that use the same schema but with different data.
    One database is for TV quotes and other database is for movie quotes.  Each database is hosted in its own VM.  These
    are our source databases that simulate using production database servers.
    The Replica VM will host both database copies.
</p>
<h3>VirtualBox Setup</h3>
<p>
    I created a pristine virtual machine (VM) with Ubuntu 22.04, OpenSSH installed, and installed MySQL
    5.7 (nothing really changed between 5.7 and 8.0 for replication).  I then made 3 clones of the pristine VM.
    Each copy was a Full Clone, Everything selected for Snapshots, and I generated new Mac addresses for all network
    adapters.
</p>
<p>
    I named the VMs SourceTV, SourceMovie, and Replica
</p>
<p class="note">
    I used NAT Network so the VMs can communicate with each other on my laptop connected to the Internet via wifi.
    I kept getting 2 IP addresses assigned by the built-in DHCP on each VM.  So what I did was run
    <span class="mono">dhclient -r</span> then <span class="mono">dhclient</span>
    a couple of times right when each VM was started.  I received a new IP address.  About 10 mins. later, a second
    IP address was assigned.  It did not interfere with communication though.
</p>
<h3>Initial Setup</h3>
<p>
    We have to first setup the 2 source database servers. No replication configuration is done yet.
    No MySQL configuration file changes have been made.  I'm using the default MySQL configurations.
    I created a database
    on each VM: one called tv and another called movie.  Next, I created the following schema for both databases:
</p>
<pre>
    create table actor
    (
        id         varchar(64)  not null primary key,
        first_name varchar(100) not null,
        last_name  varchar(100) not null
    );

    create table quote
    (
        id          varchar(36) not null primary key,
        actor_id    varchar(64) not null,
        send_date   datetime    not null,
        line        text        not null,
        constraint actor___fk
        foreign key (actor_id) references actor (id)
    );
</pre>
<p>
    I added the following for TV data:
</p>
<pre>
    INSERT INTO actor (id, first_name, last_name) VALUES ('lucy', 'Lucille', 'Ball');
    INSERT INTO quote (id, actor_id, send_date, line) VALUES ('5e58c6f9-0c4e-11ed-8d91-080027b72d1a', 'lucy',
    '2022-08-01 00:00:01', 'Ethel and I have decided that you have married us and not a television set.');
</pre>
<p>
    I added the following for Movie data:
</p>
<pre>
    INSERT INTO actor (id, first_name, last_name) VALUES ('will', 'Will', 'Ferrell');
    INSERT INTO quote (id, actor_id, send_date, line) VALUES ('4e58c6f9-0c4e-12ed-8d91-080027b62d1a', 'will',
    '2022-08-01 00:17:05', 'You sit on a throne of lies.');
</pre>
<p>
    I then did a mysqldump on each of the databases, started up the Replica VM, copied the mysqldump .sql files over
    to Replica by using scp from inside the Replica VM, created both databases in the Replica VM, and applied the
    .sql files using the SOURCE command from inside the MySQL client.
</p>
<h3>Replication Configuration</h3>
<p>
    These instructions apply to all 3 VMs:
<ul>
    <li><span class="mono">service mysql stop</span></li>
    <li><span class="mono">rm /var/lib/mysql/auto.cnf</span></li>
    <li>
        Edit <span class="mono">/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysql.cnf</span>
        <ul>
            <li>Change bind-address value to assigned IP address (don't have to do this one for Replica)</li>
            <li>Add the following:
            <ul>
                <li>server-id = &lt;Integer&gt; # Unique for each MySQL server</li>
                <li>log-bin = mysql-bin</li>
                <li>gtid-mode = ON</li>
                <li>enforce-gtid-consistency = ON</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
    These instructions apply only to the Replica VM:
<ul>
    <li>Add additional configuration to <span class="mono">/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysql.cnf</span>
        <ul>
            <li>relay-log = relay-log-server</li>
            <li>read-only = ON</li>
            <li>log-slave-updates = ON</li>
            <li>master-info-repository = TABLE</li>
            <li>relay-log-info-repository = TABLE</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Run <span class="mono">service mysql start</span> on all 3 VMs</p>
<h3>Create Replication User Account</h3>
<p>
    These instructions apply to the 2 source VMs:
<ul>
    <li>Launch the mysql client</li>
    <li>
        Create user account that the Replica will use for replication on each of the source servers:
        <ul>
            <li>TV
                <ul>
                    <li>CREATE USER 'tv'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'tv';</li>
                    <li>GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'tv'@'%';</li>
                    <li>FLUSH PRIVILEGES;</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Movie
                <ul>
                    <li>CREATE USER 'movie'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'movie';</li>
                    <li>GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'movie'@'%';</li>
                    <li>GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'movie'@'%';</li>
                    <li>FLUSH PRIVILEGES;</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Replication Statements</h3>
<p>
    These instructions apply only to the Replica VM:
<p>Launch the mysql client</p>
<p>Create connection information for the TV source database:</p>
<pre>
    CHANGE MASTER TO
    MASTER_HOST = '&lt;Source TV IP Address&gt;',
    MASTER_USER = 'tv',
    MASTER_PASSWORD = 'tv',
    MASTER_AUTO_POSITION = 1
    FOR CHANNEL 'source_tv';
</pre>
<p>Create connection information for the Movie source database:</p>
<pre>
    CHANGE MASTER TO
    MASTER_HOST = '&lt;Source Movie IP Address&gt;',
    MASTER_USER = 'movie',
    MASTER_PASSWORD = 'movie',
    MASTER_AUTO_POSITION = 1
    FOR CHANNEL 'source_movie';
</pre>
<p>Command to start replication for each source database server:</p>
<pre>START SLAVE FOR CHANNEL 'source_tv';</pre>
<pre>START SLAVE FOR CHANNEL 'source_movie';</pre>
<p>To verify that the replica is running, run the following to verify that the status is waiting for updates:</p>
<pre>SHOW SLAVE STATUS FOR CHANNEL 'source_tv';</pre>
<pre>SHOW SLAVE STATUS FOR CHANNEL 'source_movie';</pre>

<h3>Test Out Replication</h3>
<p>
    Start creating records on the source databases and then query the tables in the replication databases to verify that
    replication works.
</p>
<p>Change over to the Source TV VM and run the following queries:</p>
<pre>
    INSERT INTO actor (id, first_name, last_name) VALUES ('carell', 'Steve', 'Carell');
    INSERT INTO quote (id, actor_id, send_date, line) VALUES (UUID(), 'carell', NOW(),
    'Sometimes I\'ll start a sentence and I don\'t even know where it\'s going. I just hope I find it along the way.');
</pre>
<p>Change over to the Source Movie VM and run the following queries:</p>
<pre>
    INSERT INTO actor (id, first_name, last_name) VALUES ('hanks', 'Tom', 'Hanks');
    INSERT INTO quote (id, actor_id, send_date, line) VALUES (UUID(), 'hanks', NOW(),
    'There\'s no crying in baseball!');
</pre>
<p>Change over to the Replica VM and run <span class="mono">SELECT * from quote;</span> to see that the new quotes were replicated successfully!</p>
